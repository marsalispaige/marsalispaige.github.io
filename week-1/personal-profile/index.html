				<h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>



				<h4 class="aboutme">Where am I from?</h4> <p class="aboutmecontent"> My name is Marsalis Paige and I'm originally from Memphis, TN. Before we move any futher, I know what you are thinking at this point. Wait, isn't Elivis Presley from Memphis, TN? Have you ever been to his house? Actually, he is not, and he's really from Tupelo, Mississippi, but don't tell Memphis that. And no, I have never been to Elvis Presley's house, however, I did live in the same neighborhood as he did. More importantly, do you know who is from Memphis, TN? The Voice of Calm. Yeah, that's right. Morgan. Freeman. He has brought you Bruce Almigthy, Shawshank Redemption, and most importantly, he was our <a class="aboutme" href="http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/do-we-really-want-another-black-president-after-th-11365"  target="_blank">first african american president </a>of these United States of America in Deep Impact. Unfortunately, he wasn't great at crisis management and we didn't get to see him in a 2nd term.</p>

				<h4 class="aboutme">Off to College</h4><p class="aboutmecontent"> I found my way to the east coast by playing football where I was recruited to attend Fairfield University in Connecticut. Nothing really much to say here about college besides from me having a crash course in understanding my liqour tolerance and my disdain for Bacardi Limon once I graduated. Fast forward to 2006, graduation year, and I am now officially an adult, or at least that's what everyone told me. I have my bachelor's degree in Marketing in one hand and a fat student loan debt in the other. I decided to have my first taste of living in New York by settling in the great borough of Queens.Things were looking up and I was on my way.</p>

				<h4 class="aboutme">Now, You are an Adult</h4><p class="aboutmecontent"> My first job out of college was doing door to door sales for a telecommunication company in Connecticut. Can you imagine going door to door to every store front and saying to them, "Hey, I know you have been using AT&amp;T since forever and a day, but why don't you come on over here and let me hook your business up with a telephone company you never heard of. You wouldn't believe how many business owners jumped on that offer. But what you can believe is how much I hated this job, but hey, I had to pay the bills and I didn't want to lose my luxury apartment, which consisted of 3 roommates and a dog that wasn't house trained. It took me nearly a year after graduation to land what I call my first "real" job out of college.</p>

				<h4 class="aboutme">Intro to Online Advertising</h4><p class="aboutmecontent">Marsalis, let me introduce you to the internet marketing world. Hey Internet Marketing world, you're bat sh*t crazy and I like it. I landed a job doing cold calls for a website which specialized in generated leads to for-profit colleges and universities. It was a small shop of nearly a dozen people located in the same office space where they filmed the TV show "Ugly Betty". You had your successful young college drop-out CEO, a couple of "I'm hot sh*t" web developers, a handful of content writers who were fresh out of college with their english majors, the CEO's best friend who is like a jack-of-all-trades and day to day coffee runner, a sales guy who aged everyone by 20 years, and finally myself. A guy who has no clue as to how the internet works and how it makes money. WTF is a CPM? CTR? People actually click on ads? Yeah, this was me. The traditional sales person who has no clue what he is talking about, talking to other sales people who have no idea what they are talking about. So, let's make a deal friend. All kidding aside, my 6 months there was the best and where I am now in my career is due to that job and the relationship that company had with it's parent company who were looking to hire a entry level reporting analysis. Guess who got hire? Oh yeah, this guy with the funny southern accent and no fashion sense. Damn, I was Ugly Betty!. A 22-year old residing in Queens with no fashion sense being thrown into an unfamiliar industry! I continued to work for the parent company for three years learning as much as I could about lead generation on the internet. This company too was involved with generating leads to for-profit colleges and universities, but at a much larger scale. It was a very eye opening experience, and where I begin to get my feet wet with learning Excel VBA Script, Excel Pivot Tables, data analysis, web analytics, and understanding how an online publisher business operates and monetized. </p>

				<h4 class="aboutme">Why am I here?</h4><p class="aboutmecontent">Working in the industry for nearly 7 years has brought me here to this course. Currently, I'm working in the ad operations, data analysis, and media buying realm of the internet advertising world. Within that realm, I work very closely with the development team with debugging and general troubleshooting of our product. Taking this course is the first step towards improving the effectiveness of my communication with the development. I'm hoping this course can provide me with a solid foundation to continue to learn and evolve within this industry. Plus, I'm a general geek and I love this stuff. </p>
