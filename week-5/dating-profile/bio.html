					<h1 id="biotitle">Who Am I?</h1>
					<p id="biointro">I'm a 40 something year old hitman, muscle, enforcer, but to put it plainly I'm just a mofo that get things done. I'm an avid bible reader and I love to teach my favorite verse, Ezekiel 25:17, which goes
					<span id="quote">'The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.'</span> People really do enjoy when I quote this bible verse.<br><br>I'm a huge burger fan! I love tasty burgers. My favorite place is Big Kahuna Burger, a Hawaiian burger joint. Did you know in France they call a quarter pound burger a royal with cheese?<br><br>What do I prefer in a match? I'm a simple man and the only thing I require is that you speak english and to not say "What" when speaking. I really can't stand it.<br><br>
					Anyway, I'm rambling. Hop over to my <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> page to check out some of other pictures.
